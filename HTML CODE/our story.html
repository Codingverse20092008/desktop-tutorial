            <h2>How We Met</h2>
            <p style="font-family: American Typewriter, serif; font-style: oblique; font-weight: 900;">The day was <b>15th January 2024</b>, a <b>Monday</b>. At exactly <b>10:02 AM</b>, I was exploring profiles on Instagram, particularly art profiles. While scrolling through, I came across a profile with an anime picture as its display. At that time, I was trying to interact with everyone, but little did I know that on that very day, while exploring, I would find the first and last love of my life.

            I followed the boy's profile, and shortly after, I received many friend suggestions. Among them, I noticed a profile with a girl's picture. She appeared older than me, or so it seemed at first glance. Without giving it much thought, I sent the first message at <b>10:02 AM</b> with a simple <b>"Hi."</b>

            I had no expectations that someone on the other side would respond so warmly. But as they say, two pure souls, no matter how far apart they are, will eventually find their way to each other. Perhaps that’s how I found her.

            And that’s how our story began—our very first encounter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>Becoming Friends</h2>
            <p style="font-family: American Typewriter, serif; font-style: oblique; font-weight: 900;">After that, we started talking. I asked her name, and she said her name was *Riddhi Prasad*. The first time she said it, I felt an inexplicable sense of comfort. I told her my name, and gradually, as we kept talking, I got to know more about her—where she lived and other little details. Slowly, I started trusting her more than anyone else, and Riddhi, too, began to trust me.

            Amidst the laughter and fun, the thought that she was just a stranger to me faded away. At that time, there were no signs of love between us. It was all about the fun and the connection we shared. I used to jokingly tell her, “You’ll always just be my sister for life.” Little did I know that the bond I teased her about would one day transform from “sister” to “wife.”

            At first, I used to fake-propose to her. I did it three times in total. But the third proposal changed my perspective entirely. It wasn’t fake anymore. Something deep inside me awakened—a feeling I had never known before. I realized that I was falling for her. I could feel myself being drawn to her, and I knew it wasn’t just attraction; it was love.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>Falling in Love</h2>
            <p style="font-family: American Typewriter, serif; font-style: oblique; font-weight: 900;">Finally, the day arrived when I first proposed to her. It was the 25th of May, 2024. I wrote a long paragraph where I mentioned that I could never love anyone else but her. Despite the many problems between us, the biggest being that I am Muslim and she is Hindu, I confessed my love for her. I knew all these differences but still fell for her, and I was certain that no one else could ever be the life partner that she could be.

            That night, she came online and saw my message. I was scared—what if she didn’t feel the same way? What if our friendship broke because of this? Still, I decided that it was time to tell her the truth—that I loved her. But my fear came true. She replied, saying that she didn’t have those kinds of feelings for me.

            I was heartbroken because, for the first time in my life, I truly loved someone, but I couldn’t have her. Still, I believed that God must have had some other plan for us. Even though our friendship didn’t break, I stopped telling her about my feelings. Months went by—June, July—and then came August, my favorite month because Riddhi’s birthday is on the 2nd of August.

            I wanted to make her birthday special in a way no one else had before. Since I’m good at coding, I created a custom animation for her to wish her a happy birthday. My unique wish made her so happy, and in that moment, I felt a glimmer of hope—that maybe, just maybe, I could make her feel the same way about me someday.

            In August itself, I started flirting with her. I realized that this was the way to approach her because, honestly, I had no idea how to flirt before. I flirted with her gently, and she would blush so much. I, too, would feel shy, but over time, my shyness faded, and I grew closer to her. We became so close that now, I am like her family.

            As time passed, I began to care for her deeply. I was always there for her, comforting her during her bad days. Whenever she was sad, regardless of who else was around, I made sure to stay by her side. And I promise to do the same in the future. Slowly, I noticed that she started developing feelings for me. Though she never said it directly, her words and actions always indirectly hinted at her love for me.

            Now, in the present, we both love each other deeply. We care for each other, take responsibility for each other, and respect each other. Over this one year, so much has happened, and I can confidently say that 2024 has been the best year of my life.

            This is how our love story began, and even now, we love each other immensely.</p>
